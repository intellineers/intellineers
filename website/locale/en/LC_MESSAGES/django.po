#~ "information. This yields huge benefits, such as providing information of "
#~ "unread documents or E-Mails or help to maximize the efficiency of "

#~ "algorithms and can be incorporated in your existing IT-Portfolio given "
#~ "the software you use provides a certain API to do so. We will help you to "
#~ "plan the integration of the Doculizer framework and to determine, whether "
